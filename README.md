Hey! My name is **Ben Schwartz**, a graduate student at the University of Michigan studying Computer Science.

I'm also an SDE Intern at [Hyland](https://www.hyland.com/en) and a teaching assistant for a [cybersecurity course](https://eecs388.org). I plan to graduate in April 2025! 

Check out my [portfolio](https://btschwartz.com/portfolio)! You may or may not regret it.
